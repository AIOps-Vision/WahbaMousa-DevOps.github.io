Welcome to my DevOps Portfolio. This website showcases my real-world DevOps experience through hands-on, production-grade projects.

It features:
- A complete **CI/CD showcase** for a real Flutter app using GitHub Actions and Docker.
- A modern, educational **C++ programming book** for beginners, written and maintained by me.
- A curated collection of **real-world DevOps challenges and solutions**, based on over 10 years of experience.

My work focuses on secure, scalable, cloud-native pipelines and infrastructure, using tools like **GitHub Advanced Security**, **Terraform**, **Prometheus/Grafana**, **Kubernetes**, and more.

üèÜ I'm a **Certified Azure DevOps Expert (AZ-400)**, **Terraform Associate**, and **GitHub Advanced Security Specialist**, with a strong record of designing automated systems for large-scale platforms.

Whether you're here to learn, hire, or collaborate ‚Äî you're welcome!
